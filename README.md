# hello-world
My first repository.

Hi, my name is Kasia and I am a beginner at programming. I am hoping to become a software developer in near future.
I am now working towards completing my MSc Computer Science qualification. I have a beautiful 9-months-old son called Leon and a wonderful fiance Alessandro. Okay, that's it for now - thanks!
